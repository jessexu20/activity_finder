We're excited to kick things off with a legendary band from North Carlina; The King Bees!\n\nTHE KING BEES have been stingin' & swingin' the blues since 1987.. Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Lincoln Center New York City (several times), they've played them all as well as Mississippi juke joints.. Their great good fortune allowed them to tour & record with the best & most culturally significant Blues artists including Carey Bell, Nappy Brown, Jerry McCain and many others...We've played with Bo Diddley and were part of B.B. King's 80th Birthday Tour..\n\n~Back in the mid-1980's they decided to quit learning just from records and go to the deep-South to apprentice to the real-deal Blues folk who created this most wonderful of American music..\" Big Jack Johnson, Frank Frost, Jerry McCain, Chicago Bob Nelson and many others took us under their wings and nurtured & guided us toward \"the sound\"... \" By the late '80's they were touring and recording with their heroes.. Their goal has always been to promote, support and pay homage to the artists who generously shared their music with us & the world...\n\n~In the mid-1990's they were signed to Amsterdam's TRAMP REORDS and over the years did several Cd's for this acclaimed international label.. Numerous European tours helped them garner many friends in blues loving countries.. By 2003 they were presenting Blues Festivals, including NEW RIVER BLUES FESTIVAL in order to showcase the great treasure of their historically important Blues mentors.. \n\n~If we have experienced any success it is due to the generosity of our Blues elders who shared & brought us up in their tradition.. We can't thank them enough! (The King Bees)\n\nNow you can experience the King Bees for yourself at the beautiful Raleigh Playhouse & Theatre!

In this class, we\u2019ll go into the use of our free arm to better develop it, as well as expand the range of motion and elevation, inviting a dynamic outlet.

It involves using your hoop as a dance partner and maintaining a single point of contact between your leg and the hoop. We'll spend time going over core techniques that have helped me harmonize my leg movements with the rolling of the hoop, as well as playing around with partner exercises and a little creative time to allow everyone to begin finding their own rhythm and style. \n\nSunday\nTwo Hoops: Flowers, Extensions, and Butterflies \n\nThis workshop explores a series of tricks and exercises that help facilitate a higher level of skill and comfort with flowers, pirouettes, and extensions of all kinds.
